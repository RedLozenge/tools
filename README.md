How to Use
==========

This repo is intended to be included as a Git submodule in side other repos,
living at supermodule/tools/. The scripts are written such that they will read
from configuration files found in supermodule/etc/, and while common templates
can be found in supermodule/tools/etc/, those files will never actually be used
by the scripts.
